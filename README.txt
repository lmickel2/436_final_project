#README
This project builds upon a previous github repo that is based off of a research paper exploring the effectiveness of deep learning models vs linear models. 
The other repo tests out different RNNS on the Chinese Stock Exchange. We replicate similar results on our paper, generate a new data set and then add features to improve accuracy.
We also added a BLSTM model to add an additional comparison. The branch google colab is the most recent, it has the added model as well as finetuned hyper parameters.
